# Model Weights Information
# 
# This file should contain the trained EfficientNet-B0 model weights.
# File name: efficientnet_b0_epoch_15_loss_0.158.pth
#
# If this file is not present, the application will fall back to 
# ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet weights automatically.
#
# To add your custom weights:
# 1. Place the .pth file in this directory
# 2. Ensure it's named: efficientnet_b0_epoch_15_loss_0.158.pth
# 3. The app will automatically detect and load it

# Note: This is a placeholder file - replace with actual .pth model weights
